description: |
  In this script we solve the lid driven cavity problem for stationary Stokes
  and Navier-Stokes flow. That is, a unit square domain, with no-slip left,
  bottom and right boundaries and a top boundary that is moving at unit
  velocity in positive x-direction.

  The script is identical to [example:official-drivencavity] except that it
  uses the Raviart-Thomas discretization providing compatible velocity and
  pressure spaces resulting in a pointwise divergence-free velocity field.
