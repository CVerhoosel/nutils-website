  In this script we solve the nonlinear Saint Venant-Kichhoff problem on a unit
  square domain (optionally with a circular cutout), clamped at both the left
  and right boundary in such a way that an arc is formed over a specified
  angle. The configuration is constructed such that a symmetric solution is
  expected.
